* My ideals for solutions are:
** Every program (unless stated otherwise) either produces a correct result or gives a reasonably clear error message.
** No solution gratuitously violates the rules for good programming and design style promoted by the book (even though early solutions obviously can't use significant features only introduced in later chapters).
** A solution does not use facilities not yet presented in the book.
** Every program is reasonably (but not verbosely) commented with comments appropriate for somone who has read the book thus far.
** Significant design choices are explicitly (if briefly) decribed.
