  Programming - Ch 11 Exercise Solutions

Modified January 17, 2010.

  * *Exercise 3*: Write a program called multi_input.cpp that prompts
    the user to enter several integers in any combination of octal,
    decimal, or hexadecimal, using the 0 and 0x base suffixes;
    interprets the numbers correctly, and converts them to decimal form.
    Then your program should output the values in properly spaced
    columns like this:

              0x4 hexadecimal converts to     67 decimal
             0123 octal       converts to     83 decimal
               65 decimal     converts to     65 decimal

  * *Exercise 9*: Write a function vectorsplit(const string& s) that
    returns a vector of whitespace-separated substrings from the
    argument s.

  * *Exercise 12*: Reverse the order of words (defined as whitespace
    separated strings) in a file. For example, *Norwegian Blue parrot*
    becomes *parrot Blue Norwegian*. You are allowed to assume that all
    the strings from the file will fit into memory at once.
