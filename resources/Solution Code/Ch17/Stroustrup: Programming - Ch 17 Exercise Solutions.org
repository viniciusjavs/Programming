  Programming - Ch 17 Exercise Solutions

Modified March 24, 2009.

  * *Exercise 1*: What is the output format of pointer values on your
    implementation? Hint: Don't read the documentation.

    Solution code
    <http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Solutions/Ch17/e17-1.cpp>.

  * *Exercise 2*: How many bytes are there in an *int*? In a *double*?
    In a *bool*? Do not use sizeof except to verify your answer.

    Solution code
    <http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Solutions/Ch17/e17-2.cpp>.

  * *Exercise 3*: Write a function, *void to_lower(char* s)*, that
    replaces all upper case characters in the C-style string *s* with
    their lower case equivalent. For example *"Hello, World!"* becomes
    *"hello, world!"* Do not use any standard library functions. A
    C-style string is a zero-terminated array of characters, so that if
    you find a *char* with the value *0* you are at the end.

    Solution code
    <http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Solutions/Ch17/e17-3.cpp>.

  * *Exercise 4*: Write a function, *char* strdup(const char*)*, that
    copies a C-style string into memory it allocates on the free store.
    Do not use any standard library functions.
