  Programming - Ch 3 Exercise Solutions

Modified July 20, 2009.

  * *Exercise 4*: Write a program that prompts the user to enter two
    integer values. Store these values in *int* variables named *val1*
    and *val2*. Write your program to determine the smallest, largest,
    sum, difference, product, and ratio of these values and report them
    to the user.

  * *Exercise 6*:
  * Write a program that prompts the user to enter 3 integer values, and
    then outputs the values in numerical sequence separated by commas.
    So: if the user enters the values 10 4 6, the output should be 4, 6,
    10. If two values are the same, they should just be ordered
    together. So, the input 4 5 4 should give 4, 4, 5.

  * *Exercise 8*: Write a program to test an integer value to determine
    if it is odd or even. As always, make sure your output is clear and
    complete. In other words, don't just output "yes" or "no". Your
    output should stand alone, like ``The value 4 is an even number.''
    Hint: see the Remainder (modulo) operator in 2.4.

  * *Exercise 9*: Write a program that converts spelled out numbers such
    as "zero" and "two" into digits, such as 0 and 2. When the user
    inputs a number print out the corresponding digit. Do it for the
    values 0,1,2,3, and 4 and write out "not a number I know" if the
    user enters something that doesn't correspond, such as ``stupid
    computer!''

  * *Exercise 10*: Write a program that takes an operation followed by
    two operands and outputs the result. For example:
      o *+ 100 3.14*
      o ** 4 5* 
    Read the operation into a string called *operation* and use an
    if-statement to figure out which operation the user wants. For
    example, *if (operation=="+")*. Read the operands into variables of
    type *double*. Implement this for operations called +, -, *, /,
    plus, minus, mul, and div with their obvious meanings.
