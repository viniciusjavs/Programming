Term | Definition | Term | Definition | Term | Definition
-----|------------|------|------------|------|-----------
abstraction | hide implementation details behind a convenient and general interface or translate ideas into code | range-**for**-statement | a boundary-safe **for**-loop | **push_back()** | method for growing a vector
**begin()** | an iterator pointing to the first element of the vector | function | a named sequence of statements | repetition | a convenient way of doing something several times
computation | take some input and produce some output | **if**-statement | the simplest form of selection between two branchs | r-value | the value of an object
conditional statement | a statement that allows selecting among alternatives | increment | add to a variable | selection | pick an alternative
declaration | give a name to an object | input | some data to be processed | **size()** | the length of a vector
definition | allocate memory for an object | iteration | a repeated sequence of statements done over a series of elements of a data structure | **sort()** | a variant of the standard library **sort** algorithm
devide and conquer | take a large problem and devide it into several little ones | loop | a way to repeat some statement | statement | a computer instruction
**else** | the second alternative of a **if**-statement | lvalue | the object itself | **switch**-statement | a selection based on comparison of a value against several constants
**end()** | an iterator to the end of the vector | member function | a function that an object has | **vector** | a dynamic sized **array**
expression | a building block that **computes** a **value** from a number of operands | output | data processed by a computer | **while**-statement | a loop structure with "on top" control variable
**for**-statement | like **while**-statement but with a more visible management of the control variable
